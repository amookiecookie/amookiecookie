# Nathaniel's Cookies


Hi, I'm Nathaniel.  I'm selling frozen cookie dough balls to help raise money for a mission trip.  A portion of my earnings will be donated to local hospitals to help fight COVID-19.


Here is something we made with my cookies! <img src="images/ice_cream_sandwich.jpg" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

To buy some frozen cookie dough balls in the Auburn/Opelika area, email me at [amookiecookie@gmail.com](mailto:amookiecookie@gmail.com).  The price for a dozen cookies balls **delivered** is $6.
